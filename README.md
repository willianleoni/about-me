I am a student in the field of Systems Analysis and Development, currently working in the exciting realm of Artificial Intelligence.

My focus is on research, development, and innovation. I firmly believe that AI can contribute to creating a more sustainable and intelligent world.

I plan to continue my studies for some years, even after degrees, and i'm eager to explore the endless possibilities AI has to offer.
